# Solid REST Browser

## treat a browser's localStorage as a mini Solid server

This library supports the use of the app:// scheme to create and access resources and containers stored in a browser's localStorage (and eventually indexedDB and other kinds of storage).  It supports rdflib's fetcher methods which means that resources in the app:// space may be addressed pretty much the same as in https;// space.
